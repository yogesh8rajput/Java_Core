### Explanation of the Graph:

1. **Basic Programming and Core Java (1-2 Months)**
   - **Topics:** Variables, data types, control flow, OOP principles, exception handling, Collections Framework, Java 8+ features.

2. **Java Development Tools (2-3 Weeks)**
   - **Tools:** IDE (IntelliJ IDEA/Eclipse), Version Control (Git), Build Tools (Maven/Gradle).

3. **Backend Development with Java (2-3 Months)**
   - **Topics:** Servlets, JSP, Spring Framework (Core, Boot, MVC), RESTful Web Services, JDBC, JPA with Hibernate, Security.

4. **Frontend Development (2-3 Months)**
   - **Topics:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), Front-end Frameworks/Libraries (React.js/Angular), Build Tools (npm/yarn, Webpack).

5. **Full-Stack Integration (2-3 Months)**
   - **Topics:** Connecting Frontend with Backend, RESTful API Integration, Project Structure, Authentication and Authorization.

6. **Deployment and DevOps (1-2 Months)**
   - **Topics:** Deployment (AWS, Heroku), CI/CD, Containerization (Docker, Kubernetes).

7. **Advanced Topics and Real-World Experience (Ongoing)**
   - **Topics:** Microservices Architecture, Testing, Performance Optimization, Soft Skills.

### Key Points:
- **Full-Time:** 9-15 months
- **Part-Time:** 18-24 months

This graphical roadmap provides a structured approach to learning full-stack development, with approximate timelines for each stage. Adjustments may be needed based on individual pace and depth of learning.
